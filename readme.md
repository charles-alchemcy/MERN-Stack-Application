Running the Project with Docker
Clone the Repository
git clone <repo-url>
cd mern-app/backend

## Build and Start the Containers

Use Docker Compose to build and run your containers:
sudo docker-compose up --build
This command will:

Build the Docker images for your application.
Start the MongoDB container and your Node.js application.
Run the Frontend

Open a new terminal, navigate to the frontend directory, and start the React application:
cd ../frontend
npm start

## Access the Application

The backend API will be available at http://localhost:3000.
The React frontend will be accessible at http://localhost:3000 (or another port if specified).
Stopping the Containers

To stop the running containers, use:
sudo docker-compose down
Notes
Ensure your MONGO_URI environment variable is set correctly in the docker-compose.yml file.
You can add any additional instructions or features specific to your project.
